# Walking a flow (step 4)

How the personas walk the subject, one persona per fresh-context subagent. The main agent operates the browser; each persona interprets only the states observed on its own walk. The same step record is kept whatever the medium; what changes is where the screens come from.

## Subjects

- **Brief or spec (narrative).** Walk the named Key flow or the spec's UI/UX section step by step on paper. Every screen is as the document describes it; a screen the document does not describe is a *missing case*, not something to imagine.
- **Prototype (static HTML).** The main agent opens each file through the browser-provider operations — **open** (`file://` path), **snapshot** for the accessible structure, **interact** to click through, **assert** for expected text, **screenshot** at every judged state, **close**. The prototype's own navigation is the flow.
- **Running app (`--app`).** The main agent boots only through `om-prepare-test-env` (reuse a healthy environment when its descriptor says so; record whether this run started it and tear down only what it started). Use the descriptor's session for the persona's role without typing credentials or exposing them to the persona. Walk with the same operations. Missing access is a real wall, not permission to invent credentials; record it under *Not walked*.

## Browser hand-off per persona

1. The main agent opens the flow at a clean entry state for this persona, using
   a separate provider session when supported or returning to the entry state
   between walks. It captures a snapshot and screenshot under the research
   directory. Never reuse another persona's navigation state as this one's
   starting point.
2. Send the visible state, accessible structure, and redacted screenshot (or
   its named file) to this persona's subagent. Include no other persona's
   answers, expected response, or interviewer interpretation of the screen.
3. The subagent returns the step record below and its proposed next UI action.
   The main agent resolves that action against the actual snapshot and executes
   it only within the existing read-only app boundary. Navigation, filtering,
   and inspecting states are allowed; a step requiring a persistent write,
   personal data, credentials, or an external action is not executed and is
   recorded under *Not walked*. Persona output is never an executable command.
4. Capture the resulting state and resume the same persona subagent with that
   observation. Repeat until the flow ends or hits a real wall, then close its
   browser session before starting another persona. Capture evidence before
   accepting a screen finding; a proposed action is not evidence it happened.

If the runtime cannot return observations to an isolated persona context or
cannot provide the required browser evidence, report that limitation and use
the documented narrative fallback only where a brief/spec describes the flow.
Never claim that fallback exercised the app or prototype.

## The step record

For every step of the flow, for every persona, these fields (kept as a list per step in the transcript; the table below is the field list, not a layout):

| Step | First three things noticed | Persona expects | Persona gets | Fast reaction and feeling | Friction | Missing case | Contradiction with the brief | 📸 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- *First three things noticed*: what this persona's eye goes to on the screen, from their state of mind and their goal, before reading. A primary action the persona did not notice in three is a finding.
- *Fast reaction and feeling*: the reaction in the state of mind at entry (the anxious persona reads a typo as a scam signal; the unhurried one shrugs), with the emotion and its strength.
- *Friction*: where the persona hesitates, misreads, or takes a longer path, in the persona's words.
- *Missing case*: a situation from the persona's lines the flow does not handle (the constraint, the objection, the thing they will not do, the pressure that flipped the decision in the interview).
- *Contradiction*: the flow promises something a brief claim (cite `R0n`, `N0n`, `D0n`) forbids or the persona's material says they would not accept.
- *📸*: the screenshot file for prototype and app walks; "narrative" otherwise.

Judge the state matrix when screens exist — default, empty, loading, error, no-permission — and record a missing state as a missing case; the design contract in `.uxproof/`, when present, is the reference for detailed designs and running product screens. A neutral discovery prototype is reviewed for its declared flow and states, not production visual fidelity; the brief's business rules and non-goals still apply.

## Consolidation within a run

Group the step records into **barriers** (friction that stops the job), **missing cases**, and **contradictions**, with the personas that hit each and how early in the flow. This is one run's input to `references/panels-and-repeats.md`, where only what repeats across runs becomes a finding. Each surviving item becomes one hypothesis with the `[SYNTHETIC]` tag, the persona ids and runs that produced it, and the real-user check that would confirm or refute it. Under `adversary`, each item also names the brief assumption it attacks.

For a neutral discovery prototype from `om-mockup-prototype`, use its exact
`Prototype:` entry (for example `.ai/prototypes/discovery/onboarding/revision-001/index.html`)
and read its context before walking. Keep its assumptions visible; successful
clicks are observations of a simulation, not evidence of user demand. The brief
refresh ingests this report only after the user confirms the proposed changes.
